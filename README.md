# ML-BasedSatelliteImageAnalysis

In this current project there is one pre-downloaded image in the form of .tif which is very useful to analyze the Satellite images. 

###### 1. Make sure that all the files are in one folder and then get that path and put into the script, the script get the path using the os module. Now, take a one pre-downloaded image from that path and assign that image to a variable for the further analysis. So, again and again we donâ€™t want to take a path of image

###### 2. For, Analysis .TIF image should be passed under the different bands like Red, Green, Blue and near Infrared. By passing the image we get the projected Width and height of the image.

###### 3. Considering the Upper left and Lower Right pixel of the image indexing and then set the to    left and bottom-right indexes of the given image. After that successively it prints their coordinates.

###### 4. Now, one by one it displays the Blue, Green, Red and near-Infrared bands.
